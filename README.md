# Lab 5 | Low-Power Modes and PWM

Angel L Garcia | Victor Hernandez

This lab is working with power consumption,

The TL;DR of this is the lower the frequency the lower the power consumption. This also applies for the pins that are active and for how long, as well as some kind of implementation or usage of the IDLE modes many processors nowadays include.
